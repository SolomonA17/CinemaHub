# 🎬 Movie Recommendation App  

## 📖 Overview  
The **Movie Recommendation App** is a dynamic, user-focused application designed to showcase practical frontend engineering skills. This project demonstrates how to integrate third-party APIs, build reusable components, and create an interactive, personalized movie-browsing experience. Users can explore trending movies, view detailed information, and save their favorites—all within a responsive and engaging interface.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- **Integrate Third-Party APIs**: Fetch real-time movie data from a public API (e.g., TMDB).  
- **Dynamic Routing**: Implement detailed movie pages using **Next.js** for smooth navigation.  
- **User Personalization**: Enable users to save and manage their favorite movies locally or via an API backend.  
- **Interactive UI**: Build a visually appealing dashboard for browsing and recommendations.  
- **Scalable Codebase**: Use TypeScript and reusable components for maintainability and scalability.
